> I was a DevOps Engineer. But I loved to put life into my ideas then I started to teach myself how to code. Now, I develop in different programming languages such as `JavaScript` and `Rust`. In order to develop user-interface, I use `ReactJS` and vanila `HTML`, `CSS/Scss` and `JavaScript`. 



**Currently, I am looking for a job. If you know any vaccancies that fit my ability please let me know.**

Here are some ideas to get you started:
