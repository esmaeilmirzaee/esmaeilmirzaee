> I was a DevOps Engineer. But I loved to put life into my ideas then I started to teach myself how to code. Now, I develop in different programming languages such as `JavaScript` and `Rust`. In order to develop a user-interface, I use `ReactJS` and vanilla `HTML`, `CSS/Scss` and `JavaScript`.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ✍🏻 I try to publish my thoughts on [Medium](https://esmaeilmirzaee.medium.com/).
- 🎨 I share my UI design on [Uplabs](https://uplabs.com/esmaeilmirzaee).
- 🖇 I have also linkedin account [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/esmaeilmirzaee).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning `Rust`.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/).
- 💬 Ask me about `JavaScript`, `NodeJS`, `Deno`, `Go`, `ReactJS`, and UI design (i.e., `Figma`, `Adobe XD`, `Adobe illustrator`)
