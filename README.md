This is my avatar, to be honest, in the past few years I gained much fat so I am on a regime to lose weight and then share my real photo.


> I was a DevOps Engineer, but I love to put life to my ideas then I started to teach myself how to code. In the last three years, I used many programming language such as `Java`, `Go`, `Ruby` and `JavaScript`. Also, I developed user-interface leveraging `ReactJS` and vanila `HTML`, `CSS/Scc` and `JavaScript` which I share some of my taghuts in my github account. 



**Currently, I am looking for a job. If you know any vaccancies that fit my ability please let me know.**
